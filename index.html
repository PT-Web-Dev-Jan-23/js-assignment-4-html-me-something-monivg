            <p>Mexico is full of a beautiful indigenous culture, traditions, and food. All of their customs
               and traditions were carried on with my family in the U.S. I had the privilege to grown up with a big Mexican 
               community in a small town in Monett, MO that the language, customs, and traditions were passed on to me.
               Even though I was born in the U.S., I felted more connected to Mexico. I have made it my mission to travel to 
               all the states in Mexico to learn more about my roots. As I go on this journey, I want to share with everyone
               the beautiful places Mexico has. </p>

               <h2>Vicente Guerrero, Durango, Mexico</h2>
               <p>First Stop, my heart is here. My father was born and raised in Vicente Guerrero, Durango, Mexico. I had to make
                  sure this was first place I visited. I fell in love with the views. As soon as you step out you see the mountains. 
                  It is just fresh and peaceful. You see the street vendors setting up their stands for to be ready. Let me tell ALL 
                  of this street vendors have the best food I have ever had. There were several things to but my top 2 things were:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Sierra de los Organos</li>
                     <li>Catedral de Durango</li>
                  </ol>

               <h2>Sombrete, Durango, Mexico</h2>
               <p>Second Stop, my heart is also here. My mother was born and raised in Villa Insurgentes, Sombrete, Zacatecas, Mexico. 
                  I couldn't mission this one either. I will say this gave me warm feeling. The people are so welcoming. There are
                  definitely more attractions here. I will say I thnk Mexico just has the best food because OMG the street vendors
                  did not disappoint. Everything I tried was amazing. There were several things to but my top 3 things were:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Zacatecas Centro</li>
                     <li>El Eden Mine</li>
                     <li>Bufa Mountain</li>
                  </ol>

               <h2>Playa Maroma, Quintana Roo, Mexico</h2>
               <p>Of course, I had to see what Cancun was about! I stayed outside of cancun probably 5 minutes away. I see why 
                  everyone loves it. It just so nice to be next a beach and have free drinks if you stay in a resort. I will
                  that was nice but the food was not the best best I've had. Beaches were beaches were beautiful and all the 
                  attractions were amazing. However, it was super busy and too many rude tourist. Don't get me wrong I had
                  a good time but next time I am going to a place with less tourist. I loved the historic attractions though and
                  they were several things liked:
               </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Isla Mujeres</li>
                     <li>Tulum</li>
                     <li>ATV tour</li>
                  </ol>
